Two variables with calloc calls were initialized in palindrome.c: rev and answer.  Neither were freed, and this is where the memory leaks came from.  We freed up rev at the end of palindrome.c right before the return statement at the end.  We had to free answer in palindrome_test.c because we needed answer to be returned within palindrome.c and be used in palindrome_test.c.  So we set palindrome(str) as a char variable, and then freed up said variable after it was used for the "assert_string_equal" stuff in palindrome_test.c.
